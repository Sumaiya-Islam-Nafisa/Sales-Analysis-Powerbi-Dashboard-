üåèOverall Financial Health

Strong Revenue: The business achieved a Total Sales (Sum of Amount) of 438K across the full period, with 6K units sold and a high total Average Order Value (AOV) of 121K.

Marginal Profitability: The Total Profit of 37K indicates the business is profitable, but the margin is thin given the high sales volume.

üìà Profit Volatility (The Main Risk)

Mid-Year Loss: The Sum of Profit by Month chart reveals severe profit instability. The business ran at a significant loss for four consecutive months: May, June, July, and August.

Strong Recovery: The second half of the year saw a sharp reversal, with October and November being the most profitable months of the entire year, fully recovering the mid-year losses and driving the overall positive 37K profit.

December Dip: Profit dropped sharply again in December, indicating the business struggles with profitability during the beginning and end of the second half of the year.

‚ú®Product & Category Focus

Volume Engine: Clothing is the dominant category, accounting for 63% of the total quantity sold, making it the primary driver of traffic and transactions.

Profit Leader: Printers is the single most profitable sub-category, followed by Bookcases. These two items (from the Electronics and Furniture categories, respectively) have the highest profit margins and are critical to the bottom line.

Lower Priority: Furniture is the smallest category by quantity at only 17%, though its sub-category Bookcases is highly profitable.

üìçGeographic & Customer Drivers

Regional Concentration: Sales are highly concentrated in the top three states: Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. These three regions are essential for maintaining sales volume.

Top Customers: Harianvish and Madhav are the highest-value customers, contributing the largest amounts of revenue.

üí∞Payment Preference

COD Dominance: Cash on Delivery (COD) is the leading payment mode, used in 44% of transactions. This indicates a strong customer preference for COD, but may also signal high operational costs (logistics, handling cash) compared to UPI (21%).
